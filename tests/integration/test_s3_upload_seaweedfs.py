"""Real-S3 integration test for the cloud-upload path, backed by SeaweedFS.

Exercises the FULL product path against a live SeaweedFS S3 gateway:

    config (cloud.s3.endpoint_url -> SeaweedFS)
      -> upload_to_cloud.get_s3_client   (the new generic-endpoint branch)
      -> upload_to_cloud.get_bucket_name
      -> upload_to_cloud.retry_upload -> upload_file -> boto3 PutObject

then verifies the object via boto3. No hand-built client — the client under
test is the one the product constructs from config, so this covers the
construction path (endpoint_url + path-style + checksum-when-required) as well
as the upload path. See ``conftest.py`` (cloud_config / s3_client / s3_bucket).

Gated behind the ``integration`` marker AND ``BITWIZE_INTEGRATION`` so the
normal suite / 3-OS matrix collect-and-skip (no SeaweedFS present).
